# Pangolin Monitor Integration for Home Assistant

This integration connects Home Assistant with Pangolin  
Previously I used Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel and after switching to Pangolin I realized that I lacked monitoring, and so I decided to quickly make an addon for monitoring the status of my tunnels.  
I will be glad to receive suggestions for new functionality.  
## Features

- Authenticate using email and password
- Tracks tunnels/sites registered in Pangolin
- Displays state (online/offline) and stats per tunnel

## Configuration

1. Go to Home Assistant Integrations
2. Add new integration -> Pangolin Monitor
3. Provide your Pangolin email, password, and server base URL
